## Inference

An inference is a conclusion drawn about a population based on the findings from your sample. 
Population must be in the report - "Back in the population..."
We take a sample to make an estimate of the population.

**Define your population clearly.**

Q. If you take a sample from FHS (12MA PCH 2018) is our whole school the population or is all secondary schools the population?
A. It could be either - that's a decision that you have to make.

The inference estimates the population parameters. (parameters are the population median) based ton the sample statistics.

Our assessment requires you to make an inference which compares 2 groups within a population using the statistical enquiry cycle.

## The PPDAC Cycle

* Problem
  * Define the problem
  * Investigate the question

* Plan
  * What to measure
  * Study design
  * Variables

* Data
  * Collect and clean.

* Analysis
  * Explore using graphs and summary statistics
  * Think Hard

* Conclusion
  * Answer the question
  * May lead to other questions
  * Communicate

## The Report

1. Introduction
  * When you look at the data, what story could it tell?
  * Categorical Variable, 2 categories, numerical variable - 1 measurement

The kiwi bird is a protected species and are supposed to be well looked after. As there is a generally higher population in the north island than the south island, the amount of care could vary dependent on location within NZ...

2. Problem
  * Write an investigative question for the given dataset. 
  * Your question must contain:
    * A numerical variable
    * 2 Categorical variables
    * Statistical parameter (median)
    * The direction of the comparison
    * The population

### Template:
Problem:
I wonder if the median [Numerical variable (units)] of [category A] is [greater than/less than] the median [numerical variable (units)] of [category B] in the population of [name and year of population dataset]

### 7/2/18

## Problem

Write an appropriate comparative question for a given population.

### Question:

I wonder if the median *budget in millions* for *action movies* is *larger than* the median *budget in millions* for *drama movies* in the population dataset of **oscar winners prior to 2011.**

The New Zealand green lipped mussel has a very high economic importance for the country. Along with most of New Zealand aquaculture, most of the mussels are typically farmed in the top of the south Island (70% in this area )

## Reminder: PPDAC Cycle

![The PPDAC Cycle](http://www.statsref.com/HTML/ppdac.png)

A PPDAC should also include an introduction and a purpose so IPPPDAC

- [x] Intro
- [x] Problem
- [x] Purpose
- [x] Plan 
- [x] Data
- [x] Analysis
- [x] Conclusion

## Purpose

The purpose should include:
* Who would be interested in the outcome of this investigation?
* Why would they be interested in this investigation? (how could they use this information?)

## Plan

* Take a suitable sample
  * Size 10-20% of the population
  * Method

600 population
20% of 600:

$$
0.2 * 600 = 120
$$
A good sample is one that is representative of the population.

# 2 Sampling Methods:
### - Simple Random Sample
### - Systematic Sample

In your report you must accurately name the method you use. Both methods give every piece of data an equal chance of being selected.

Both methods give every piece of data an equal chance of being selected.

Each time a sample os selected it is almost certain that it will be a different sample to the last one so of course different sample stats (median) will occur

This is known as...

=========================================================================
# S  A  M  P  L  I  N  G    V  A  R  I  A  B  I  L  I  T  Y
=========================================================================

**You must discuss sampling variability in your report!**

A larger sample size will reduce the variability between samples and improve the estimates of the population.

## Assessment Checklist

- [x] Define the variables you are using and their units
- [x] Take a sample of 30 (or the specified amount) from both categories.
- [x] State the name of your sampling method
- [x] Describe the steps you took to obtain your sample
- [x] Discuss why you chose that particular sampling method
- [x] Discuss whether your sample is representative of the population.

## Simple Random Sample:

* Numerically label the data
* Enter into your calculator:
$$
populationRAND + 1
$$
* Press **[ = ]**  or **[ EXEC ]** and highlight the piece of data that corresponds to the random number.
* Truncate the output (ignore decimals)
  [119.738348 -> 119]
* Continue pressing **[ = ]** or **[ EXEC ]** until 30 of both categories are selected.

### 9/2/18

# Systematic Sampling Method

1. Select a random starting place using [ populationRAND + 1 ] on your calculator
2. Calculate K value:
$$
K = \frac{populationSize}{sampleSize}
$$
3. Select every Kth value from the starting point.
4. Continue around the entire population until the sample size is reached. 

If K is rounded down, then you may not cover the entire population.
If K is rounded up, you will go past your starting point and sometimes land on your start. Just highlight the next one.


### 13/2/18

# Justifying Sampling method:

### Simple Rand. Sample:
   Advantages:
       * Every person/item in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
       * There is no pattern of predictability of those selected
       * It is quick and easy for small populations 
   Disadvantages:
        * It is time consuming to numerically label the population
        * It is time consuming if the population is large
        * My not produce a representative sample if there are subgroups in each category

### Systematic sampling
   Advantages: 
         * It is quick and easy for large populations
         * Only one random number is required. (the start point)
         * It covers the entire population. Which is good for subgroups. 
         * You don't need to number the data
         * Every person/item in the population has an equal chance of being selected.
   Disadvantages:
         * There is a chance that the sample is not representative. Especially if there is a repeating pattern in the subgroup.

Note: A large population is usually 1000+ or on several pages.

### 16/2/18

# Analysis

* Include your graph
* Discuss the features of the sample distribution by making comparisons between the 2 groups **and** back it up with summary values.
* Use "I notice that" as your sentence starter.
* We are particularly interested in the middle 50% of the sample which is the box.
* Always talk about the distribution in context.

# DiSCUSS

Distribution involves:
- Shift
- Centre
- Unusual Features
- Shape
- Spread

## Shift

* Which box (middle 50%) is further up the scale or do the boxes overlap?
  * Back this up with LQ and UQ
* Does this shift match the direction in your question?
* What could possibly explain this shift?
* Would you expect this same shift back in the population?

From the box and whisker graph, I notice that the middle 50% of the sample from site a is further up the scale than the middle 50% of the sample from site B.

The LQ for site A sample is 26g which is 2g larger than the UQ (24g) for site B.

This indicates that the middle 50% of the snails from the site A sample are heavier than the middle 50% of the snails from the site B sample.

This does not surprise me and matches the direction in my question. 

I wonder if this shift seen in my sample would similar to the shift in the population. I believe it wouldn't be as there are other factors (such as gender, age, pollution, food source, predators) that may contribute to the weight of the snails and I have not considered these factors when selecting my sample.

![Apples Box and Whisker Graph](~/Documents/All School/12MA/Stats/apples_new.png)

From the box and whisker graph, I notice that the middle 50% of apples grown on the left fall into the middle 50% of apples grown on the right.

The median apples grown on the left of the road falls well within the interquartile range of the apples grown on the right side of the road. The medan value for apples grown on the left is 119 apples which is very close the the median value... continue later

### 19/2/18

Centre:
Which median is greater?
By how much is it greater?
Does this match the direction in your question?

## Unusual Features

Gaps
Clusters
Are there any items/people that look out of place to you? (extreme values)
  DO NOT USE "OUTLIERS" USE "EXTREME VALUES"


From the box and whicker graph, I notice that the median for sample A [SAMPLE A VALUE] us [DIFFERENCE] greater than/less than the median for sample B [SAMPLE B VALUE]

From the box and whisker graph, I notice that the median value for apples grown on the left (119) is 8.5 apples less than the median value for apples gown on the right side (127.5). This difference is not significant as the median for apples grown on the left falls well within the interquartile range for apples grown on the right side of the road. This leads me to believe that soil fertility is not dependent on what side of a road you are on. However, the sample size that was used in this investigation means that sampling variability could be high and therefore not yield accurate results. There is also a very wide spread and even spread with relatively insignificant outliers.

## DiSCUSS

# Shape:

Is there any symmetry in the middle 50%? (box)
Is there any symmetry overall?

![](http://www.comfsm.fm/~dleeling/statistics/images/threedistribution-boxplots-histos.png)

### What shape is the dot plot?

![Dot plot shapes](https://sites.google.com/a/tamaki.ac.nz/mr-sharma-maths-tc/_/rsrc/1454375218504/year-12/statistical-inference/analysis-1/shape.png)

Skewed to the right: Tail is to the right
Skewed to the left: Tail is to the left
Irregular distribution: Self explanatory. Dots are irregular.

## Shape Comment

For apples grown on the right side of the road, there is a visible skew to the right which is seen in the box plot. As for the left, there is a more symmetrical distribution within the middle 50% with a very slight skew to the left. 

## Spread

Only discuss the interquartile range (UQ - LQ).
Make a comparison between the two categories.
Relate the spread of the middle 50% to **VARIATION** in data about the median.

Reflect on wether you think you would find the same spread in the population and WHY.

## Spread comment

From the box and whisker graph, I notice that sample...

# Informal Confidence Intervals (ICI)

Sampling variability:
We know that each sample taken is most likely different to all the other samples taken.

Each sample therefore has different sample statistics (median in particular)

How to we use our sample median to estimate the population median if everyones sample medians are different.

We use an informal confidence interval which is an interval within which we can be reasonably sure that the actual population median occurs.

The formula to calculate an ICI is:

$$
median + \frac{1.5 * IQR} {\sqrt{n}}
$$
OR
$$
median - \frac{1.5 * IQR} {\sqrt{n}}
$$

### Definitions:
$$
IQR = UQ-LQ
$$
$$
n = SampleSize
$$
The length of the confidence interval depends on 3 things but we only discuss 2 of them.
1. The spread of the sample If the IQR is large then ICI will be wider.
2. The sample size. If our sample size is large, then the sample representative of the population and so the confidence interval should be smaller.

To halve the confidence interval, we need a sample that is 4 times as large.

**YOU MUST STATE WHAT A CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IS TO GAIN ACHIEVED**

## Sampling Variability

Sampling variability describes how much multiple samples differentiate from each other. Is is mainly affected by sample size. If you take a small sample, that sample is more prone to variability as opposed to a large sample size which is less prone to variability. Larger samples are more representative of the population and therefore vary less between samples.

## Informal Confidence Interval

An informal confidence interval is a range of where it is probable that the population median will fall under. A narrower confidence interval means that the sample median will deviate less from the population median and a wider confidence interval means that the sample median will deviate more from the population median. Generally speaking, the narrower a confidence interval, the more representative your sample is.

## My Investigation

The Informal Confidence intervals have been presented on the above graph. 
The informal confidence interval for apples grown on the left spans from 100.02 apples to 137.98 apples. The informal confidence interval for apples grown on the right spans from 105.85 apples to 149.15 apples.

  **YOU MUST MAKE AN INFERENCE** which is an estimate of the population medians based on the samples taken.
  
  Use your ICI's to make your inference.
  
Based on the ICI, I believe that the population medain falls in between ... and that for

# CONCLUSION
### If you get your conclusion wrong, instant NA with no resub.

You need to state whether you can make a call (or claim) about te categories back in the population. 

This statement is based on whether your ICI's overlap or not.

If you can make a claim (or call) about categories back in the population, then you must state what this claim is.

If they overlap, you **cant** make a call back in the population.
If they do not overlap, you **can** make a call back in the population.

## Practice Conclusion:

Based on the informal confidence intervals, I am unable to make the claim that single sex schools as the confidence intervals are overlapping.


## Discussion:

You need to reflect on aspects of the investigation in context. E.g. Thinking about limiting factors in the definitions of the groups and identify on the reliability if the estimates.
