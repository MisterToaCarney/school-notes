__12EG Notes__
==============

- If $F > UTS =$ fracture
- If $F > UCS =$ corrugation

## Defs

$$
P = \frac{F}{A}
$$

## Safety Factor

The 50cc frame is designed with a safety factor of 2.

If you a frame is rated for 70kg with a safety factor of 2, the frame will begin to break at 140kg

$$
W_{max} = W_{rated} * S_{fac}
$$
