* "Gurgle + froth" -> Onomatopoeia.

### Sample Paragraph:
In the first stanza, positive connotations convey the mood to the reader through the use of sound and image techniques. The mood in the first stanza was happy and busy. Imagery, positive connotations and onomatopoeia work together to convey the mood of the workers. The author conveys the positive mood through the use of imagery, "Burst..." This encourages the reader to imagine the workers bursting into the store for their shift. The author couples imagery with onomatopoeia to portray the positive mood. "Gurgle... bubbles" are examples of both onomatopoeia and imagery working to display the mood. This shows the reader/me that the mood can change at any time but luckily each day is a new beginning.

Rhetorical Question??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
* How do you spell, South Auckland????????????????????????????????
* H-O-???????
* How do you spell hoary.

Repetition
* "Just listen, listen to me"
* "The life in her eyes, lost. ...in her arms, lost"



What language features were used to develop the description of South Auckland?

In the first stanza, rhetorical questioning was used to develop the description of south Auckland. An example of a rhetorical question used in this context is "How do you spell south Aukland?" He then follows up this question with an answer that is questionable. "H-O?" By using this sort of questioning, Sheldon re-enforces the pre-existing stereotype that is that south Aucklanders are not intelligen/t.

# WELCOME HOME

Entering Your Home

* Enter house
* There is a guy in a fursuit.
* Gets mugged by guy in fursuit


Am walking down the street. There is my house. There is a broken window. Shrugged it off because broken windows are fairly common. Walking towards my house. I use my keys to enter my house via the front door. I say to myself "Welcome Home." I then notice that there is a hole in my floor. I decided to go into the hole because that is the most safe and logical action to take. It is a large tunnel network created by what seemed like an army of furries. I assume this because there is a substantial congregation of these furies just around the corner. After realising that I was in danger, I immediately turned back and fled. Unfortunately, the furries heard me and are now pursuing me. I exit the hole in my floor in a hurry. I then begin to throw furniture items down the hole as an attempt to slow the impending storm of furries. Sadly there were too many furries and they flooded into my house. I ran away because I did not feel welcome in my house. Eventually, my house had to be quarantined and later demolished.
