__12PH Notes - Mechanics__
==========================


We use the SI system of units in Physics
  * What does SI stand for? - International System of Units (french: Système international)
  * List the SI units for
    * Length = Meter - m
    * Mass = Kilogram - kg ????? Why does it have a prefix?
    * Time = Second - s
    * Temperature = Kelvin - K
    * Electric Current - Ampere - A
    * Luminous Intensity - Candela - cd

Why do we use the SI system?
> It is derived from invariant constants. Which can be observed and measured with high accuracy.

# Definitions:

### Distance:
> How **far** an object travels, without concern for direction
### Displacement:
> How far an object travels __from a reference point.__
> There is an important difference between these two quantities - imagine you are walking to school, if you add up the steps you walk in total, then you will know the **distance.** However, if you work out how far you are from home *in a straight line* then you are calculating your displacement. 

![Distance vs Displacement Diagram](http://thescienceclassroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/distance-and-displacement.png)

- The length of the dotted line is **distance.**
- The length of the straight line is displacement (We need the direction too)


Note that distance is a scalar quantity, we know the **magnitude** (the size) but not the direction, and displacement is a **vector** quantity which has **magnitude** and *direction.*

### 19/3/18

Billy bob is running around a track - complete table to show distance and displacement at points a,b,c

|              | distance | displacement |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| Start/Finish | 0m       | 0m/null      |
| A            | 50m      | 50m/000˚     |
| B            | 100m     | 70.71m/045˚  | 
| C            | 150m     | 50m/090˚     |

Pythagoras' Theorem:
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

The velocity of an object describes its change in displacement divided by the time taken i.e
$$
V = \frac{\Delta d}{\Delta t}
$$

It differs from speed because direction is taken into account. (velocity has magnitude and direction)

We usually measure velocity + speed in meters per second ($ms^{-1}$ or $m/s$)

Next, we often need to know the **rate** at which the velocity of an object is **changing** - This is the objects *acceleration*, measured in meters per second per second ($ms^{-2}$) 

$\Delta =$ delta, "change in"

e.g. $\Delta V$ = change in velocity = acceleration.

Acceleration can be positive (speeding up or increasing velocity) or negative (slowing down or decreasing velocity)

It can be **zero** (constant speed or velocity)

You can be traveling at constant *speed* and still have acceleration **if** you are changing direction! 
> Remember, velocity has magnitude **and** direction, change in either means a change in velocity.

# Kinematic Equations

- These are used to solve problems involving ***uniform acceleration*** in a straight line.

They use the variables:
* $V_i$ - initial velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
* $V_f$ - Final velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
* $a$ - acceleration ($ms^{-2}$)
* $t$ - time ($s$)
* $d$ - displacement ($m$)

Kinematics

Q1.
Sarah releases a red car, from rest, down a slope of length 0.5 m.

The red car accelerates steadily and reaches a speed of $1.5ms^{-1}$ when it gets to the bottom of the slope.

Calculate the acceleration of the red car as it moves down the slope.

$V_f = 1.5ms^{-1}$

$d = 0.50m$

$$
V_f = V_i + at
$$
$$
V_f - at = V_i
$$

# Newtons Laws of Motion

1. If there are **no** *unbalanced* forces present, then the motion of an object remains the same. (no change in direction or speed, or it remains stationary)
2. If there **are** *unbalanced* forces present, then there will be a change in velocity (an acceleration) in the direction of the unbalanced force. $F=ma$ or $a=\frac{F}{m}$
3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

# Projectile Motion

Projectile = an object the moves solely under the influence of gravity. (So long as air resistance is negligible)

Newton tells us that an unbalanced force will produce an acceleration in the direction of the force.

Since gravity is an unbalanced force acting on the projectile, we must have an acceleration **downwards.**
