# The Plum Pudding Model

The plum pudding model is a model of the atom that was proposed by J.J. Thompson in the late 19th century. 
As the name implies, the model appears to look a lot like a plum pudding. It consists of a large positive charge (the pudding) that contains an amount of negative charges/eletrons inside of it (the plums).

# The gold foil experiment

Rutherford fired alpha particles at a piece of gold foil. He observed that:
* Most particles went through the foil
* Some were deflected into different directions
* A few were rebounded back

# Plum Pudding + Rutherford Models

In the late 1800s J.J. Thomson proposed that atoms were made up of a ball of positive charge, studded with negatively-charged electrons - The atom overall was electrically neutral. This model he explained as being similar to a plum pudding with the electrons being the fruit and the dough being the positive charge.

Rutherford's Experiment was devised to test this model: but the observations that resulted led to a new model being required. His idea was to fire alpha particles (He2+ nuclei) at a thin sheet of gold foil a few hundred atoms thick and see what happened.

He observed that:
  1. Most particles passed straight through the foil
  2. A small number (around 1 in 8000) were deflected as the passed through the foil
  3. Very few particles actually bounced back from the foil.

### Questions
For each of the observations above, explain what it meant in terms of the structure of the atom.

  Observation 1: Most particles passed straight through the foil
    - This means that there must be a lot of empty space. The atom is mostly empty space.

  Observation 2: A small number (around 1 in 8000) were deflected as the passed through the foil
    - This means that the alpha particles were colliding/repelling from the gold atoms. This shouldn't occur with a plum pudding model as the whole atom is supposed to be neutral and not attract/repel any particles. The nucleus had to be positively charged.
  
   Observation 3: Very few particles actually bounced back from the foil.
     - The alpha particles are being directly repelled by something in the gold foil.
      

Why did there need to be a vacuum in the chamber?

- Air itself consists of a lot of different atoms. This would interfere with the alpha particles to a point where they may not even reach the gold foil. The alpha particles need a completely clear/unobstructed pathway in order to reach the gold foil.

### 9/2/18

What were the three observations that Rutherford made and the three conclusions he reached?

1. Most alpha particles passed through the gold foil undeflected.
    Rutherford concluded that the gold atoms consisted of mostly empty space.
    > An atom is mostly empty space.
2. Some alpha particles were deflected (about 1 in 8000)
    This means that something is repelling the alpha particles which doesn't make sense with the plum pudding model as with that model, the entire atom is supposed to be neutral and not have an effect on the alpha particles.
    > The gold nucleus is positively charged.
3. Very few bounced back.
    The alpha particles are being directly repelled by the gold nucleus. 
    > Most of the mass was in a dense nucleus at the centre of the atom.

# The Nucleus

The nucleus of an atom consists of protons and neutrons.

The *Atomic Number* of an element is the number of **protons** in the nucleus. (The periodic table is arranged by atomic number).
  
The *Mass Number* of an element is the number of **protons + the number of neutrons.** It tells us how many **nucleons** (particles in the nucleus) make up the nucleus.
  
  > We can calculate the number of neutrons by:
$$
MassNo. - AtomicNo.
$$
e.g. Oxygen has 8 protons and [ 16 - 8 = 8 ] neutrons.
e.g. Lead has 82 protons and [ 207 - 82 = 125 ] neutrons.

Each atom of an element has the same number of protons *but* may have a different number of neutrons
We call these **isotopes** of the element.

A nuclear reaction is a rearrangement or charge in the particles that make up the nucleus (nucleus, nuclear)

A radioactive substance e.g. Uranium can emit an alpha particle, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons { He(2+) }. Because uranium has 92 protons and 238-92 neutrons neutrons, when it emits the alpha particle it is no longer a uranium atom.

# Radiation

## Alpha Particles 

Alpha particles travel the shortest distance through air and are easily stopped by only a sheet of paper. Alpha particles are the most biologically destructive and can cause radiation poisoning in small doses. Alpha particles can be deflected by a magnetic field. 

## Beta Radiation

Beta radiation travel a longer distance through air Beta radiation is less destructive than alpha particles but is more destructive than gamma radiation. Beta radiation can be halted by an aluminium plate. Beta radiation is deflected by magnetic fields.

## Gamma Radiation

Gamma radiation travels the longest distance through air as compared to alpha and beta. Gamma radiation is the least destructive out of alpha and beta but is the hardest to shield against. A thick wall of mass such as lead can be used to stop gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is not affected by magnetic fields.

# Radioactivity

Large nuclei (larger than Lead) are often *radioactive*, that is, they are prone to **decay** where they emit particles of radiation from their nucleus. This decay is random (we can't say *when* a particular atom will decay) and occurs because the force holding the larger nuclei together is weaker than in smaller nuclei. (The electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged protons pushes the nuclei apart)

Nucleons (particles in the nucleus) are held together with nuclear force.

![Nuclear Force](https://www.wonderwhizkids.com/images/content/physics/modern_physics/nucleus/Concept_map/image3.gif)

There are three types of radioactive decay we need to know about:

## Alpha particles α
These consist of two protons and 2 neutrons (like a helium nucleus, which is why it is sometimes written as:
$$
[He^{2+}]
$$
- They have a positive charge so are influenced by a magnetic field
- They travel at around 10% of the speed of light
- They are strongly ionising, so are able to remove electrons from other atoms.
- But only have a range of a few centimetres and can be stopped by a sheet of paper.
- They are very dangerous if inhaled or swallowed.

## Beta particles β

- These are high energy **electrons**
- They are emitted from the *nucleus* when a neutron breaks down into a proton and an electron (the beta particle)
- They travel at high speed, around 90% of the speed of light.
- Travel further than alpha particles, around *30cm* in air. But can be stopped by aluminium around 5mm thick.
- Have a negative charge, so are also deflected by a magnetic field *but* in the opposite direction to alpha particles.
- They are usually written as:

$$
\beta^{0}{-1}
$$

## Gamma radiation

- This is high frequency electromagnetic radiation (EM) and often accompanies other radioactive decay
- Because it is EM radiation, it travels at the speed of light.
-  Very penetrating, able to pass through several centimetres of lead
-  Has no charge, therefore is not affected by a magnetic field.
-  The symbol is:
$$
\gamma
$$

# Half Life

While we cannot predict when a particular *atom* will decay, we can accurately predict the rate at which a sample of radioactive material will break down. 

When the number of disintegrations plotted against time, an exponential decay curve is formed.

![Radioactive decay curve with half life.](http://www.splung.com/nuclear/images/radioactivity/half-life.png)

The **half life** of a radioactive substance is the *time* taken for half the undecayed atoms in a sample to disintegrate. This is used as a measure of the rate of decay. Half life times vary enormously, from hours to thousands of years.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. A radioactive source has a half life of 80 days. How long will it take to decay to 1/16 of its original amount.

$$
\sqrt{16} * 80 = 320
$$
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Radiocarbon Dating


### Q.
1. What is the isotope used in this form of dating?
2. What is the source of this isotope?
3. How does it end up in plants and other living creatures.
4. What do scientists do to find out how long it is since the living material died.

### A.
1. The isotope used in radiocarbon dating is Carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon. 
2. Carbon is found naturally in organisms, but is produced in the upper layers of the troposphere and the stratosphere. Carbon-14 production takes place at an altitude of approximately 9-15 kilometres high.
3. Carbon-14 ends up in plants because they absorb the carbon that is present in the atmosphere. Many sources of food are derived from plants. This means that any organism that were to eat plants, would receive a dose of carbon-14. Organisms are constantly exchanging carbon with their surroundings.
4. Once an organism dies, it ceases to acquire carbon from it's surroundings. The carbon-14 that is present in the organism will no longer be replenished and will begin to decay.

Q2.
    Thomson's plum pudding model is a model of the atomic structure that consists of a positive structure containing an amount of electrons. This is reflected in the plum pudding as the positive structure being the pudding and the electrons being the plums in the pudding. Rutherford's model of the atom introduced a number of changes to the atom. The most apparent one is the introduction of the nucleus. The idea of the nucleus is that it is a very positive central charge with a lot of space
